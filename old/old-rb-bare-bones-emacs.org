* Introduction

My local =.emacs= is /enormous/ and grows by the hour.

But I find myself working on other machines, either by
ssh'ing into them or at a different desktop that I don't use
enough to justify my full setup, but still use enough times
for the little stuff to become /very/ annoying.

All I need is a very basic dotemacs that I can put on
servers when I set them up to make remote workflow a little
easier.

That's all this file is.

  ;;; Deerpig's Barebones .emacs file.
  ;;; (c)2017,2019 Brad Collins, Phnom Penh.
  ;;; Licence: MIT/CC BY-SA 4.0
  ;;;
  ;;; This is part of a literate program that was tangled 
  ;;; from one of the following repos:
  ;;;
  ;;;  https://github.com/deerpig/runbooks/blob/master/rb-bare-bones-emacs.org
  ;;;  http://git.chenla.org/deerpig-public/runbooks/blob/master/rb-bare-bones-emacs.org
  ;;;
  ;;;  I also add the following alias in ~/.bashrc
  ;;;
  ;;;     alias qmacs='emacs -nw -q --load ~/.emacs.d/minmacs.el'
  ;;;
  ;;;  The 'q' is for quick. This opens emacs with no windows using
  ;;;  this init file.  
  ;;; 
  ;;;  Now for a true story:
  ;;;
  ;;;     "Daddy, is there emacs in heaven?"
  ;;;
  ;;;     "Well my dear daughter, if there wasn't, you couldn't really
  ;;;     call it heaven, now could you." The father stroked his long
  ;;;     beard thoughtfully and whispered, almost to himself, "But what
  ;;;     keeps me awake at night is if you can take your .emacs with
  ;;;     you!"

I know this is a religous issue, but I've found life easier
without tabspace characters mucking things up.

The following can only be used if you are running X.  If you
try to use them in emacs-nox, you'll get an error.

I know what I'm doing, so don't clutter up the screen with 
the the tool, menu, scroll bars or splash screen.

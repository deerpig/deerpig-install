Documents using the Keywords section *MUST* use include the
following text in it's own section named /Keywords/.

#+begin_quote
The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*, *SHOULD*,
*SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and *OPTIONAL* in this
specification are to be interpreted as described in [[rfc:2119][RFC2119]].

Since a document and project of this nature deals with a
large number of technologies, each with their own set of
acronyms, please refer to the glossary in Appendix A, which
briefly explains some of them.
#+end_quote


* Notation

Formal grammers are given in this specification using a
simple Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation described
in [[rfc:4234][RFC4234]]. Further information and links can be found in
the Wikipedia article [[wiki:Extended_Backus–Naur_Form][Extended Backus–Naur Form]].

** EBNF Syntax Highlighting in Emacs

The following [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/1804038][code]] was in a comment on Stack Overflow:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-generic-mode 'bnf-mode
  () ;; comment char: inapplicable because # must be at start of line
  nil ;; keywords
  '(
    ("^#.*" . 'font-lock-comment-face) ;; comments at start of line
    ("^<.*?>" . 'font-lock-function-name-face) ;; LHS nonterminals
    ("<.*?>" . 'font-lock-builtin-face) ;; other nonterminals
    ("::=" . 'font-lock-const-face) ;; "goes-to" symbol
    ("\|" . 'font-lock-warning-face) ;; "OR" symbol
    ("\{:\\|:\}" . 'font-lock-keyword-face) ;; special pybnf delimiters
   )
  '("\\.bnf\\'" "\\.pybnf\\'") ;; filename suffixes
  nil ;; extra function hooks
  "Major mode for BNF highlighting.")

* Date formats

All dates *SHOULD* be written using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601][ISO8601]] format, unless a
good reason to do otherwise.  When using another date format
the date must be unambigious.

Date formats are one of the oldest and thorniest problems in
computing.


ISO8601 format is as follows:

#+begin_example
YYYY-MM-DD
#+end_example

Compare this to the American convention:

#+begin_example
10-10-10
#+end_example

This example could be any of, 10 January 1910, 10 January
2010, 10 October, 1910 or 10 October 2010.



* Code Header and Copyright Notice
* Version Numbers

The matter of Version numbers for software and documentation comprise
no small amount of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_and_gnashing_of_teeth][weeping and knashing of teeth]] so let's make this
clear and simple.  All Version numbers *MUST* conform to the Semantic
Versioning [[http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html][v2.0.0]] specification.  From the [[http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html][spec]]:

#+begin_quote
Given a version number *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*, increment the:

 - *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes,
 - *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
   manner, and
 - *PATCH* version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH* format.
#+end_quote

Version numbers *SHOULD* append a lower case letter v to version
numbers unless there is a sound reason to do otherwise.

** EBNF Definition

The =EBNF= definition for Semantic Version Numbers:

#+begin_src ebnf
digit ::= 0 |1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 
major ::= <digit>+
minor ::= <digit>+
patch ::= <digit>+

semantic-version ::=  v<major>.<minor>.<patch>   
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_quote
These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing
widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source
software. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public
API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code
itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and
precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to
it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version
format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API
increment the patch version, backwards compatible API
additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards
incompatible API changes increment the major version.

I call this system “Semantic Versioning.” Under this scheme, version
numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying
code and what has been modified from one version to the next.
